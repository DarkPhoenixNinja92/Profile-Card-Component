## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to keep an eye on even the little things as they can cause unforseen problems easily. Just to name one, I had a couple of variables set up to hold my font sizes but because I was importing the index file for the section where I use the variables before the one where the variable was declared, SASS was giving me an error because I was trying to call a variable before it had been declared.

### Continued development

Going forward, I want to refine my SASS skills and improve at nesting and reducing my code down to be less repetitive as I still have problems with repeating myself in CSS when I could just be calling a mixin or something similar.
